<p style="font-style:0.9em"><b><a href="https://stuartcraig.github.io/files/CraigJMP_ESHI.pdf">Competition in Employer Sponsored Health Insurance: Implications for a Public Option (JMP)</a></b></p>
<div class="content">
<div class="row">
  <div class="col">
    <p style="font-size:0.8em"> I explore the conditions under which a government insurance plan, or “public option,” generates additional premium competition in the insurance market. Using unique data on employer-insurer contracting and a model of supply and demand, I document evidence of large switching costs and variation in expected costs across employers. Insurers respond to switching costs by setting low premiums for new employers and raising them for those who are locked-in. I use the model to test the impact of a public option and show show that uniform premium setting (i.e. community rating) substantially limits the public option’s ability to compete with private insurers who set employer-specific premiums. A public option that offers experience rated premiums and discounts to new employers is substantially more attractive and therefore has a larger impact on premium competition. A community rated public option that aggressively regulates prices for health care services obtains substantial market share, but is less effective at generating competition among existing insurers.</p>

<!--- Price Variation Between Payers --->
<p style="font-style:0.9em"><b><a href="https://stuartcraig.github.io/files/w25190.pdf">How Important Is Price variation Between Health Insurers?</a> Journal of Health Economics, 2021,</b> <i>with Keith Ericson and Amanda Starc</i></p>
<div class="content">
<div class="row">
  <div class="col">
    <p style="font-size:0.8em"> Prices negotiated between payers and providers affect a health insurance contract’s value via enrollees’ cost-sharing and self-insured employers’ costs. However, price variation across payers is difficult to observe. We measure negotiated prices for hospital-payer pairs in Massachusetts and characterize price variation. Between-payer price variation is similar in magnitude to between-hospital price variation. Administrative-services-only contracts, in which insurers do not bear risk, have higher prices. We model negotiation incentives and show that contractual form and demand responsiveness to negotiated prices are important determinants of negotiated prices.</p>

<div class="content">
<div class="row">
  <div class="col">
    <p style="font-size:0.8em">We estimate the effects of hospital mergers, using detailed data containing medical supply transactions (representing 23 percent of operating costs) from a sample of US hospitals 2009-2015. Pre-merger price variation across hospitals (Gini coefficient 7 percent) suggests significant opportunities for cost decreases. However, we observe limited evidence of actual savings. In this retrospective sample, targets realized 1.9 percent savings; acquirers realize no significant savings. Examining treatment effect heterogeneity to shed light on theories of "buyer power," we find that savings, when they occur, tend to be local, and potential benefits of savings may be offset by managerial costs of merging.</p>

<!--- The Price Ain't Right --->

<p style="font-style:0.9em"><b><a href="https://stuartcraig.github.io/files/qjy020.pdf">The Price Ain’t Right? Hospital Prices and Health Spending on the Privately Insured</a> Quarterly Journal of Economics, 2019,</b> <i>with Zack Cooper, Martin Gaynor, and John Van Reenen</i></p>
<div class="content">
<div class="row">
  <div class="col">
    <p style="font-size:0.8em">We use insurance claims data to study the variation in health spending on the privately insured, examine the structure of insurer-hospital contracts, and analyze the variation in hospital prices across the nation. Prices vary substantially across regions, across hospitals within regions, and even within hospitals. Hospital market structure is strongly associated with price levels and contract structure. Prices at monopoly hospitals are 12% higher than those in markets with four or more rivals. Monopoly hospitals also have contracts that load more risk on insurers. In concentrated insurer markets the opposite occurs—hospitals have lower prices and bear more financial risk. Examining the 366 mergers and acquisitions that occurred between 2007 and 2011, we find that prices increased by over 6% when the merging hospitals were geographically close (e.g., 5 miles or less apart), but not when the hospitals were geographically distant (e.g., over 25 miles apart).</p>

<!--- 
      <p><b>Background</b></p>
      <p>Women with gynecologic cancer face socioeconomic disparities in care that affect survival outcomes. The Affordable Care Act offered states the option to expand Medicaid enrollment eligibility criteria as a means of improving timely and affordable access to care for the most vulnerable. The variable uptake of expansion by states created a natural experiment, allowing for quasi-experimental methods that offer more unbiased estimates of treatment effects from retrospective data than the traditional regression adjustment.</p>
      <p><b>Objective</b></p>
      <p>To use a quasi-experimental, difference-in-difference framework to create unbiased estimates of impact of Medicaid expansion on women with gynecologic cancer.</p>
      <p><b>Study Design</b></p>
      <p>We performed a quasi-experimental retrospective cohort study from the National Cancer Database files for women with invasive cancers of the uterus, ovary and fallopian tube, cervix, vagina, and vulva diagnosed from 2008 to 2016. Using a marker for state Medicaid expansion status, we created difference-in-difference models to assess the impact of Medicaid expansion on the outcomes of access to and timeliness of care. We excluded women aged <40 years owing to the suppression of the state Medicaid expansions status in the data and women aged ≥65 years owing to the universal Medicare coverage availability. Our primary outcome was the rate of uninsurance at diagnosis. Secondary outcomes included Medicaid coverage, early-stage diagnosis, treatment at an academic facility, and any treatment or surgery within 30 days of diagnosis. Models were run within multiple subgroups and on a propensity-matched cohort to assess the robustness of the treatment estimates. The assumption of parallel trends was assessed with event study time plots.</p>
      <p><b>Results</b></p>
      <p>Our sample included 335,063 women. Among this cohort, 121,449 were from nonexpansion states and 213,614 were from expansion states, with 79,886 posttreatment cases diagnosed after the expansion took full effect in expansion states. The groups had minor differences in demographics, and we found occasional preperiod event study coefficients diverging from the mean, but the outcome trends were generally similar between the expansion and nonexpansion states in the preperiod, satisfying the necessary assumption for the difference-in-difference analysis. In a basic difference-in-difference model, the Medicaid expansion in January 2014 was associated with significant increases in insurance at diagnosis, treatment at an academic facility, and treatment within 30 days of diagnosis (P<.001 for all). In an adjusted model including all states and accounting for variable expansion implementation time, there was a significant treatment effect of Medicaid expansion on the reduction in uninsurance at diagnosis (−2.00%; 95% confidence interval, −2.3 to −1.7; P<.001), increases in early-stage diagnosis (0.80%; 95% confidence interval, 0.2–1.4; P=.02), treatment at an academic facility (0.83%; 95% confidence interval, 0.1–1.5; P=.02), treatment within 30 days (1.62%; 95% confidence interval, 1.0–2.3; P<.001), and surgery within 30 days (1.54%; 95% confidence interval, 0.8–2.3; P<.001). In particular, large gains were estimated for women living in low-income zip codes, Hispanic women, and women with cervical cancer. Estimates from the subgroup and propensity-matched cohorts were generally consistent for all outcomes besides early-stage diagnosis and treatment within 30 days.</p>
      <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p>Medicaid expansion was significantly associated with gains in the access and timeliness of treatment for nonelderly women with gynecologic cancer. The implementation of Medicaid expansion could greatly benefit women in nonexpansion states. Gynecologists and gynecologic oncologists should advocate for Medicaid expansion as a means of improving outcomes and reducing socioeconomic and racial disparities.</p>

<div class="content">
<div class="row">
  <div class="col">
    <p style="font-size:0.8em">We examined the growth in health spending on people with employer-sponsored private insurance in the period 2007–14. In the study period private health spending per enrollee grew 16.9 percent, while growth in Medicare spending per fee-for-service beneficiary decreased 1.2 percent. There was substantial variation in private spending growth rates across hospital referral regions (HRRs): Spending in HRRs in the tenth percentile of private spending growth grew at 0.22 percent per year, while HRRs in the ninetieth percentile experienced 3.45 percent growth per year. The correlation between the growth in HRR-level private health spending and growth in fee-for-service Medicare spending in the study period was only 0.211, suggesting that different factors may be driving the growth in spending on the two populations.</p>

    <p style="font-size:0.8em">We analyzed growth in both types of prices for inpatient and hospital-based outpatient services using actual negotiated prices paid by insurers. We found that in the period 2007–14 hospital prices grew substantially faster than physician prices. For inpatient care, hospital prices grew 42 percent, while physician prices grew 18 percent. Similarly, for hospital-based outpatient care, hospital prices grew 25 percent, while physician prices grew 6 percent. Policy makers should consider a range of options to address hospital price growth, including antitrust enforcement, administered pricing, the use of reference pricing, and incentivizing referring physicians to make more cost-efficient referrals.</p>

    <p style="font-size:0.8em">The ESI assesses the individual-level occurrence of substantial year-to-year declines in available household resources, accounting for fluctuations not only in income but also in out-of-pocket medical expenses. It also assesses whether those experiencing such declines have sufficient liquid financial wealth to buffer against these shocks. We find that economic insecurity has risen steadily since the mid-1980s for virtually all sub-groups of Americans, though there is substantial disparity in the degree to which different subgroups are exposed to economic risk. We find that the degree and disparity by which insecurity has risen is robust across the best available data sources.</p>
