I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate at Yale University's Tobin Center for Economic Policy. My research focuses primarily on bargaining in business-to-business markets, and has been featured in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/12/15/upshot/the-best-places-for-better-cheaper-health-care-arent-what-experts-thought.html">NYT</a>, the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/health-cares-cost-conundrum-squared">New Yorker</a>, and <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2015/12/14/health-care/unprecedented-look-medical-costs-nationwide">NPR Marketplace</a>. My <a href="https://stuartcraig.github.io/research/#job-market-paper">job market paper</a> studies whether a public option would increase competition in the market for employer-sponsored health insurance. Prior to Yale, I completed my PhD at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.
