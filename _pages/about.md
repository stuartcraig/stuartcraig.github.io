I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate at Yale University's Tobin Center for Economic Policy. My research focuses primarily on the causes and consequences of rising health care spending in the US, with a focus on competition and price setting in business-to-business health care markets. I completed my PhD at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania (2021). 

Starting Fall 2023, I will be joining the University of Wisconsin-Madison (Wisconsin School of Business) as an Assistant Professor of Risk and Insurance.
