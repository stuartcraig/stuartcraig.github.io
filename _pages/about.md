I am an Asisstant Professor of Risk and Insurance at UW-â€“Madison's Wisconsin School of Business. I study the causes and consequences of rising health care spending in the US, with a focus on competition and price setting in business-to-business health care markets. 

Prior to joining UW, I served a post-doc at Yale University's Tobin Center for Economic Policy. I completed my PhD at the University of Pennsylvania (Wharton) in 2021.
